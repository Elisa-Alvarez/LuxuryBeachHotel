## To Veiw Application

`cd resort` then once in the resort directory `npm start`

### Room Data

All the Room data comes from the service contentful and was hand made for this project. Currently there are only 3 rooms 2 single and one double and all of them need more styling and better images added.

### For Future Updates

Css needs to be added to the rooms page and the individual rooms themselves. In latter versions the plan is to add GSAP (Green Socks Animation) to the home and rooms page as well as material UI styling to the Search Filter.

*Major Updates*: For a future realse of the application would include a bookings page as well as checkout functionality.
